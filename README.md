# ❄️ Cold Email Generator

Generate personalized cold emails for recruiters, hiring managers, and networking outreach using an LLM, with a simple Python app that calls the Groq HTTP API.

## 💡 What it does

This app helps you quickly create targeted cold emails by taking a few inputs and sending them to an LLM:

- Your role or goal (internship, full time, networking, collab, etc.)
- Company or person you are emailing
- Your relevant skills or experience
- Tone and style you want

The app then returns a cleaned, structured email that you can copy, tweak, and send.
